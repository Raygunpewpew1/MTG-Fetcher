## **Setup Instructions**

### **1. Clone the Repository**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Raygunpewpew1/MTG-Fetcher.git
```

### **2. Install Required Libraries**
- [`JsonDataObjects`](https://github.com/ahausladen/JsonDataObjects)

### **3. Install WebView2 SDK (Required for UI Rendering)**
- Open Delphi and go to **Tools > GetIt Package Manager**.  
- Search for **WebView2 SDK** and install it.  
- This ensures you have the correct `WebView2Loader.dll` that **Delphiâ€™s WebView2 component requires**.

### **4. Configure the Project**
- Open the project in Delphi.
- Ensure all necessary paths and libraries are correctly set up.

### **5. Verify WebView2Loader.dll Deployment**
The correct `WebView2Loader.dll` must be included in your project's output folder (`Win64\Debug\` or `Win64\Release\`).  

- If missing, manually copy it from:  
  ```
  C:\Users\yourusername\Documents\Embarcadero\Studio\23.0\CatalogRepository\EdgeView2SDK-*\Bin\x64\WebView2Loader.dll
  ```
### **6. Run the Application**
- Compile and execute the project on Windows.

## **How to Use**

1. Launch the app and enter your search query (e.g., card name, set code).

## **Why WebView2Loader.dll from GetIt Is Required**
- The WebView2Loader.dll from the **GetIt SDK** is required because **Delphi's WebView2 implementation is tied to that version**.
- Using a system-installed WebView2Loader.dll **may cause crashes or incompatibility issues**.
- This ensures that all contributors use the correct DLL version.
