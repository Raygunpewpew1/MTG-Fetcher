# MTG Fetcher

MTG Fetcher is a FireMonkey-based Delphi application designed to streamline Magic: The Gathering (MTG) card browsing and information retrieval using the Scryfall API. It provides a user-friendly interface for searching, viewing, and filtering card details, such as card images, legalities, prices, and more.

## About
**Now Requirs Delphi 12+ as it uses string literals.**

This project was developed using **Delphi Community Edition**, a free version of Embarcadero Delphi intended for individual developers, open-source projects, and small companies. It leverages Delphiâ€™s powerful FireMonkey (FMX) framework to create a cross-platform application with support for Windows and Android. 

The application retrieves MTG card data directly from Scryfall, enabling advanced features such as:
- Card image viewing (including support for double-faced cards).
- Filtering cards by set, rarity, color, and other attributes.
- Displaying card legalities, power/toughness, mana cost, and prices.

**Now Requirs Delphi 12+ as it uses string literals.**

For Windows, **WebView2Loader.dll** is also needed. You need to use Delphi's GetIt and download the
EdgeView2 SDK, You may also need to copy the file to the root build directory. 

To set up and run the application on another machine, follow these steps:

1. Verify Setup:

The application now will download a bulk file from scryfall after running the app for the first time,
saves the bulk file to \Users\username\AppData\Roaming\MTGCardFetch folder then loads the bulk data into memory.

It also grabs a few json files from scryfall for use in the project,(catalogs.json for instance).
Havent tested on Android.

card_template.html is included for referance though it has changed inside delphi.

2. Run the Application:

The application should now work as intended! In theroy!
